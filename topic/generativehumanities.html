                Digital Humanities = Big Humanities = <strong>Generative Humanities</strong>. Whereas the revolution of
                the post-WWII era
                has consisted in the proliferation of ever smaller and more rigorous areas of expertise and
                sub-expertise, and the consequent emergence of private languages and specialized jargons, the Digital
                Humanities is about integration and generative practices: <strong>the building of bigger pictures out of
                    the tesserae of expert knowledge</strong>. 
                <img src="../img/puzzle.gif" alt="">    
                It is not about the emergence of a new general culture,
                Renaissance
                humanism/Humanities, or universal literacy. On the contrary, it promotes collaboration and creation
                across domains of expertise. The expert is here to stay BUT:

                    there’s no reason for his or her natural habitat to fall exclusively within the walls of academe or
                    think tanks)
                </li>
                <li>
                    the demand for ever increasing degrees of specialization must be placed under constant pressure by
                    the need for transversal, transdisciplinary, innovative thinking
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Digital Humanities = <strong>Co-creation</strong>. Because of the complexity of Big Humanities projects, 
                <strong>teamwork</strong>, specialized roles within teams, and “production” standards that imply specialization become defining
                features of the digital turn in the human sciences. Large scale, distributed models of scholarship
                represent one of the transformative features of the Digital Humanities.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there is ample room under the Digital Humanities for the reinvention of the solitary, “eccentric,”
                even hermetic work carried out by lone individuals both inside and outside the academy.

                the network and the monastery are both potential places of pleasure, knowledge, and
                reward within an economy founded on abundance. But we can no longer entrust knowledge creation and
                knowledge stewardship solely to the latter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern scientific models of scholarship have prided themselves on the equation between rigor and the
                affect-neutral relaying of disembodied information. Yet this Enlightenment myth has long done battle
                with aestheticizing or styled forms of scholarly communication in ways that have become distinctive to
                the Humanities, and sometimes pitted them against prevailing practices in the social and natural
                sciences. Digital Humanities doesn’t preclude one or the other flavor of scholarship. It accommodates
                both. But <strong>by emphasizing design, multimediality, and the experiential, it seeks to expand the compass of
                the affective range to which scholarship can aspire</strong>. As such it gladly flirts with the scandal of
                entertainment as scholarship, scholarship as entertainment. It respectfully resists the notion that
                scholarship speaks outside of time, space, and the physicality of the human body. It is actively engaged
                in the task of creating an audience –even a mass audience—for humanistic learning.
