            <p>Digital Humanists recognize <strong>curation</strong> as a central feature of the future of the
                Humanities disciplines.</p>
            <p>
                Whereas the modern university segregated scholarship from curation, demoting the latter to a secondary,
                supportive role, and sending curators into exile within museums, archives, and libraries, the Digital
                Humanities revolution promotes a fundamental reshaping of the research and teaching landscape. It
                recasts <strong>the scholar as curator and the curator as scholar</strong>, and, in so doing, sets out
                both to reinvigorate scholarly practice by means of an expanded set of possibilities and demands, and to
                renew the scholarly mission of museums, libraries, and archives. A university museum worthy of its name
                must become at least as much a laboratory as, say, a university library. An archive must become a place
                of teaching and hands-on learning. The classroom must become a place of hands-on engagement with the
                material remains of the past where the tasks of processing, annotating, and sequencing are integral to
                process of learning. Curation also has a healthy modesty: it does not insist on an ever more impossible
                mastery of the all; it embraces the tactility and mutability of local knowledge, and eschews disembodied
                Theory in favor of the nitty-gritty of imagescapes and objecthood.
            </p>

             <p>
                Curation means <strong>making arguments through objects as well as words, images, and sounds</strong>.
                It implies a
                spatialization of the sort of critical and narrative tasks that, while not unfamiliar to historians, are
                fundamentally different when carried out in space—physical, virtual, or both—rather than in language
                alone. It means becoming engaged in collecting, assembling, sifting, structuring, and interpreting
                corpora. All of which is to say that we consider curation on a par with traditional narrative
                scholarship. It is a medium with its own distinctive language, skill sets, and complexities; a medium
                currently in a phase of transformation and expansion as virtual galleries, learning environments, and
                worlds become important features of the scholarly landscape.

            <p>
                Curation also implies <strong>custodial responsibilities</strong> with respect to the remains of the
                past as well as interpretive, meaning-making responsibilities with respect to the present and future. In
                a world of perpetual data overload, it implies information design and selectivity: the channeling,
                filtering, and organization into intelligible and usable information; the digging up of new or long
                ignored cultural corpora. Most of these corpora are simply sitting in storage: less than 1% of the
                Smithsonian Institution’s permanent collection is on view to visitors; less than 10% of an average
                research library’s books are ever consulted; vast corpora of cultural materials lie outside the
                collection and acquisition missions of research libraries and archives. Archives will continue to
                undergo explosive growth. Digital Humanists must be there, alongside librarians and archivists, to think
                critically about the challenges and opportunities that such explosive growth provides.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Curation is an augmented scholarly practice that also powerfully augments teaching and
                    learning</strong>. It
                summons future generations of humanists to set to work right from the start with the very stuff of
                culture and history: to become directly engaged in the gathering and production of knowledge under the
                guidance of expert researchers in a true laboratory-like setting.
                The universe of Humanities research is vastly enriched by the addition of curatorial work to the range
                of recognized and supported "outputs" for scholarship. Curation creates the preconditions for modes of
                scholarship that step outside the boundaries of one's own expert language into a more fluid public
                realm, where traditional forms of scholarship can be multipurposed for the large-scale participatory
                generation of archival repositories under the expert guidance of a scholar.

                    just a repository; it's just pedagogy). They have rarely, if ever, built software, parsed code,
                    created a database, or designed a user interface. They are uni-medium scholars (most likely of
                    print) who have been lulled into centuries of somnolence. </li>
