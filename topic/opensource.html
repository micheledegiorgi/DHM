                Digital Humanities have a utopian core shaped by its genealogical descent from the
                counterculture-cyberculture intertwinglings of the 60s and 70s. This is why it affirms the value of the
                open, the infinite, the expansive, the university/museum/archive/library without walls, the
                democratization of culture and scholarship, even as it affirms the value of large-scale statistically
                grounded methods (such as cultural analytics) that collapse the boundaries between the humanities and
                the social and natural sciences. This is also why it believes that copyright and IP standards must be
                freed from the stranglehold of Capital, including the capital possessed by heirs who live parasitically
                off of the achievements of their deceased predecessors.

                            Ignore the well-intentioned “voices of reason” that will always argue for interpreting
                            scholarly or artistic fair use in the most restrictive manner (so as to shield the
                            institutions they represent from lawsuits, no matter how improbable or unfounded); adopt
                            vigorous interpretations of fair use that affirm that, in the vast majority of cases,
                            scholarship and art practice: a) are not-for-profit endeavors whose actual costs far
                            exceed real or potential returns; and b) are endeavors that, rather than diminishing the
                            value of IP or copyright, enhance their value.

                Digital humanists defend the rights of content makers, whether authors, musicians, coders, designers, or
                artists, to exert control over their creations and to avoid unauthorized exploitation; but this control
                mustn’t compromise the freedom to rework, critique, and use for purposes of research and education.
                Intellectual property must open up, not close down the intellect and proprius.

                Digital Humanities implies <strong>the multi-purposing and multiple channeling of humanistic
                    knowledge:</strong> no
                channel excludes the other. Its economy is abundance based, not one based upon scarcity. It values the
                COPY more highly than the ORIGINAL. It restores to the word COPY its original meaning: abundance. COPIA
                = <strong>COPIOUSNESS</strong> = THE OVERFLOWING BOUNTY OF THE INFORMATION AGE, an age where, though
                notions of
                humanistic research are everywhere under institutional pressure, there is (potentially) plenty for all.
                And, indeed, there is plenty to do.
