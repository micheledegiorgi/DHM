                Disciplines and disciplinary traditions can be wellsprings of quality, depth, and rigor. They can also
                be bastions of small thinking, clerical privilege, and intellectual policing. But do traditional
                departments really provide an effective means to safeguard a central role for the Humanities in
                contemporary society? Why, then, haven’t they evolved? Why defend the very disciplinary structures that
                emerged in the course of the formation of modern universities in the 19th century even when the
                intellectual ground has shifted out from under their feet?
            </p>
            <p>Here are a few reasons (there are more):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the power of <strong>tradition</strong></li>
                <li>cognitive <strong>conservatism</strong></li>
                <li>nostalgia/<strong>comfort</strong></li>
                <li>institutional <strong>inertia</strong></li>
                <li>tenure and <strong>promotion</strong> systems </li>
                <li>lobbies and <strong>bureaucracies</strong></li>
                <li>class <strong>values</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../img/sleeping.gif" alt="Spongebob character Patrick Star is sleeping in his house">
            <p>
                Knowledge of the Humanities as constituted in the modern university has shaped lives, conveyed critical
                skills, provided a moral compass for human experiences, given pleasure and satisfaction, inspired acts
                of generosity and heroism. Digital Humanities represent an effort not to downplay or "downsize" these
                traditional merits but, on the contrary, <strong>to reassert and reinterpret their value</strong> in an
                era when our
                relation to information, knowledge, and cultural heritage is radically changing, when our entire
                cultural legacy as a species is migrating to digital formats. The work of the human sciences remains
                critically necessary in such as setting. BUT it cannot be carried out (successfully or, for that matter,
                interestingly) in the ways it was carried out for many many decades: in isolation, in disciplinary
                silos, in Ivory Towers, communicated in ever more hermetic language games, indifferent to the media
                revolutions underway within our culture as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                So let's imagine <strong>a new topography</strong>: not just disciplinary, but one involving alternative
                configurations
                for producing knowledge--open-ended, global in scope, designed to attract new audiences and to establish
                novel institutional models. Perhaps "Digital Humanities" itself becomes a distributed "virtual
                department" overlaid on current departments, weaving together shifting archipelagos of researchers from
                intellectually and geographically diverse disciplines on the basis of overlapping research networks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Or, let’s simply reinvent the department as a <strong>finite knowledge problematic</strong> which comes
                into existence
                for a limited period, only to mutate or cease as the research questions upon which it is founded become
                stale and their explanatory power wanes. Here are a few, real or potential such topographies:
            </p>

            <h3>Department of Print Culture Studies</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this department is to study the materiality of printed texts, constructions of
                authorship, linguistic forms, the history of the book, book publication, and distribution systems;
                antecedents to and descendents of print, as well as the relationships and tensions between print culture
                and digital culture. Its “masterpieces” will no longer be authorial, but will encompass the work of
                master printers, typographers, and layout artists who transformed standards and practices.
            </p>

            <h3>Institute of Vocal Studies</h3>
            <p>The historical and critical study of the voice as a communicative instrument, from the standpoint of the
                evolution of techniques of vocalization, shifting conceptions of the “natural,” and the history of vocal
                effects. The field is divided between research into vocal performance in premodern rhetoric and song;
                and large scale automated mining of the archives of recorded sound.</p>

            <h3>School of Erasure Studies</h3>
            <img src="../img/eraser.gif" alt="Gif of an elegant man holding in his hands a hat and an umbrella. He is swinging from left to right and 
            he's erasing an abstract painting with his head">

            <h3>Discipline of Cultural Mapping</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this discipline is to examine the junctions between space/time, information, and culture.
                It brings geographic analyses together with historical methods, visual analysis, and the presentation of
                complex datasets and visualizations. It also examines the cultural and social impact of digital mapping
                technologies and the significance of these mapping technologies for understanding cultural phenomena.
            </p>

            <h3>Laboratory for Cultural Analytics</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this lab is to bring quantitative analyses from applied math, statistics, and the social
                sciences together with large-scale, complex social and cultural datasets.
            </p>
