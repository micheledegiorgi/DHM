            <p>Our emblem is a digital photograph of a hammer (manual making) superimposed over a folded page (the 2d
                text that now unfolds in three dimensions).</p>
            <p>
                Centuries of text-based scholarship and the primacy of the press created the context within which print
                culture became naturalized. Needless to say, we are NOT arguing for the abolition of books.
                <img src="../img/catbook.gif" alt="A cat reading a book and turning the pages">
                On the contrary, we are advocating for <strong>a neo- or post-print model</strong> where print becomes embedded
                within a multiplicity of media practices and forms of knowledge production. It is one in which architecture and
                design (again) become central features of how research questions get formulated as well as communicated,
                shaped, and styled. This is an incredibly exciting moment in which determining and designing the
                interface to information, data, and knowledge becomes just as central as the crafts of writing,
                curating, and coordinating.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dichotomy between the manual realm of making and the mental realm of thinking was always misleading.
                Today, the old theory/praxis debates no longer resonate. <strong>Knowledge assumes multiple
                    forms</strong>; it inhabits
                the interstices and criss-crossings between words, sounds, smells, maps, diagrams, installations,
                environments, data repositories, tables, and objects. Physical fabrication, digital design, the styling
                of elegant, effective prose; the juxtaposing of images; the montage of movements; the orchestration of
                sound: they are all making.

                Let's not forget: though their traditions were rooted in oratory and rhetoric, the modern Humanities
                disciplines were profoundly reshaped around and by the medium of print, just as now they are confronting
                the challenges of being profoundly reshaped by newly emergent digital norms and potentialities. What
                does it mean to study "literature" or "history" when print is no longer the normative medium in which
                literary or historical artifacts are produced, let alone analyzed?
            </p>
            <p>
                What does it mean to think when thinking is decoupled from its exclusive reliance upon language and
                textuality? What does it mean, more generally, for humanistic knowledge?
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 70s and 80s, women's studies, LGBTQ studies, ethnic studies, and cultural studies opened up the
                humanities to address issues of social, political, and cultural disenfranchisement and possibilities for
                re-enfranchisement. The Humanities was no longer the domain of the proverbial "old white man." Now,
                Digital Humanities deconstructs the very materiality, methods, and media of humanistic inquiry and
                practices. But we must persist in asking: Where did humanities disciplines come from, in response to
                what kind of needs, with what sort of explanatory power? How did its practices, truth-making strategies,
                knowledge products, media forms, and ways of evaluating utterances get naturalized? Traditional
                Humanities is balkanized by nation, language, method, and media. Digital Humanities is about
                convergence: Not only between humanities disciplines and media forms, but also between the arts,
                sciences, and technologies.

            <h2>The theory after Theory is anchored in MAKING</h2>
            <p>
                Making in the poetic sense of poeisis, but also in the sense of design carried out in action, the
                modeling and fabrication of intelligent things, the generative and re-generative aspects of creation and
                co-creating. The 20th century left us with a vastly expanded set of spectacles arranged for our viewing
                pleasure. 21st century networks and interactions reengage the spectators of culture, enabling them to
                upload meaningfully, just as they download mindfully.
