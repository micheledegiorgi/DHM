                Digital Humanities is not a unified field but an <strong>array of convergent practices</strong>
                that explore a universe in which:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                        print is no longer the exclusive or the normative medium in which knowledge
                        is produced and/or disseminated; instead, print finds itself absorbed into new,
                        multimedia configurations;
                </li>
                <li>
                        digital tools, techniques, and media have altered the production and dissemination
                        of knowledge in the arts, human and social sciences.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Digital Humanities seeks to play an inaugural role with respect to a world in which, no longer
                the sole producers, stewards, and disseminators of knowledge or culture, universities are called upon
                to shape natively digital models of scholarly discourse for the newly emergent public spheres of the
                present
                era (the www, the blogosphere, digital libraries, etc.), to model excellence and innovation in these
                domains, and to facilitate the formation of networks of knowledge production, exchange, and
                dissemination
                that are, at once, global and local.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like all media revolutions, the first wave of the digital revolution looked backward as it moved
                forward.
                Just as early codices mirrored oratorical practices, print initially mirrored the practices of high
                medieval
                manuscript culture, and film mirrored the techniques of theater, the digital first wave replicated the
                world
                of scholarly communications that print gradually codified over the course of five centuries: a world
                where
                textuality was primary and visuality and sound were secondary (and subordinated to text), even as it
                vastly
                accelerated the search and retrieval of documents, enhanced access, and altered mental habits. Now it
                must
                shape a future in which the medium-specific features of digital technologies become its core and in
                which
                print is absorbed into new hybrid modes of communication.
            </p>

                The first wave of digital humanities work was quantitative, mobilizing the search and retrieval powers
                of
                the database, automating corpus linguistics, stacking hypercards into critical arrays. The second wave
                is
                <strong>qualitative</strong>, <strong>interpretive</strong>, <strong>experiential</strong>,
                <strong>emotive</strong>,
                <strong>generative in character</strong>. It harnesses digital toolkits in
                the service of the Humanities’ core methodological strengths: attention to complexity, medium
                specificity,
                historical context, analytical depth, critique and interpretation. Such a crudely drawn dichotomy does
                not
                exclude the emotional, even sublime potentiality of the quantitative any more than it excludes
                embeddings of
                quantitative analysis within qualitative frameworks. Rather it imagines new couplings and scalings that
                are
                facilitated both by new models of research practice and by the availability of new tools and
                technologies.
            </p>

                Interdisciplinarity/transdisciplinarity/multidisciplinarity are empty words unless they imply
                <strong>changes in
                    language</strong>, <strong>practice</strong>, <strong>method</strong>, and <strong>output</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Empty or not, these words have paved the way. But now it’s time to model the future through projects
                that do
                more than talk the talk.
