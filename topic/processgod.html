                <strong>Process is the new god;</strong> <span>not product</span>. Anything that stands in the way of
                the perpetual mash-up and remix
                stands in the way of the digital revolution. Digital Humanities means iterative scholarship, mobilized
                collaborations, and networks of research. It honors the quality of results; but it also honors the steps
                by means of which results are obtained as a form of publication of comparable value. Untapped gold mines
                of knowledge are to be found in the realm of process.

                Today, the universitas (universe of knowledge) has become far too vast, multilayered, and complex to be
                contained within the walls of any single institution, even one as broadly conceived as the university.
                The (medieval) fiction of universal inquiry has long been belied by the reality of fields of learning
                restricted to a few choice areas and eras. The Digital Humanities <strong>embraces and harnesses the
                    expanded,
                    global nature of today’s research communities</strong> as one of the great
                disciplinary/post-disciplinary
                opportunities of our time. It dreams of models of knowledge production and reproduction that leverage
                the increasingly distributed nature of expertise and knowledge and transform this reality into occasions
                for scholarly innovation, disciplinary cross-fertilization, and the democratization of knowledge.

                <strong>throwing down the gauntlet I</strong>: the most significant Web 2.0 creation to harness a mass
                audience and
                engage a mass audience in knowledge production and dissemination is Wikipedia.
                <strong>Wikipedia</strong> wasn't
                invented at/as a university. But it’s fast on the way to becoming one (Wikiversity). Wikipedia is a
                model because it is far more than a set of contents: it represents a truly global, multilingual
                authorship and editorial collective for gathering, creating, and managing information.

                <strong>throwing down the gauntlet II</strong>: take <strong>Google</strong>, like it or not. It
                originated at Stanford, but its home turf
                is in the corporate world. Yet its aspiration to become a modern-day Library of Alexandria and Oracle of
                Delphi is no longer wildly improbable: "to organize the world's information, making it universally
                accessible and useful" reads the Google mission statement. The Google homepage has become the portal to
                the world's (digital) information; Google Earth has become the normative mappa mundi now in the hands of
                the world community.

                Not only to seek to understand and interrogate the cultural and social impact of new technologies, but
                to
                be engaged <strong>in driving the creation of new technologies,
                    methodologies, and information systems, as well as in their détournment, reinvention, repurposing,
                    via
                    research questions grounded in the Arts and Humanities</strong>: questions of meaning,
                interpretation, history,
                subjectivity, and culture. The revolution is not about transforming literary scholars into engineers or
                programmers. Rather, it is about:

                Wiki-nomics is the new social, cultural, and economic reality for Digital Humanists. Technologies and
                content are mass(ively) produced, authored, and administered, even if shaped by specific communities of
                practice that generate, in turn, quality standards and models of best practice. Wiki-scholarship is
                iterative, cumulative, and collaborative. Social media are the new laboratories of culture and knowledge
                making. In the humanistic domain, Wiki-nomics implies:
