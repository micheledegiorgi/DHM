            <p>
                We wave the banner of “Digital Humanities” for tactical reasons (think of it as "strategic
                essentialism"), not out of a conviction that the phrase adequately describes the tectonic shifts
                embraced in this document. But an emerging transdisciplinary domain without a name runs the risk of
                finding itself defined less by advocates than by critics and opponents, much as cubism became the label
                associated with the pictorial experiments of Picasso, Braque, and Gris.
            </p>
            <p>
                The phrase has use-value to the degree that it can serve as <strong>an umbrella under which to group
                    both people
                    and projects seeking to reshape and reinvigorate contemporary arts and humanities practices, and
                    expand
                    their boundaries</strong>. It has use value to the degree one underscores its semantic edges: the
                edge where
                digital remains contaminated by dirty fingers, which is to say by notions of tactility and making that
                bridge the (non-)gap between the physical and the virtual; the edge where humanities suggests a
                multiplication of the human or humanity itself as a value that can (re)shape the very development and
                use of digital tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reject the phrase to whatever degree it implies a digital turn that might somehow leave the
                Humanities intact: as operating within same stable disciplinary boundaries with respect to society or to
                the social and natural sciences that have prevailed over the past century.
            </p>
            <p>
                We further reject the phrase to the degree that it suggests that the humanities are being modified by
                the digital, as it were, “from the outside” with the digital leading and the Humanities following. On
                the contrary, our vision is of a world of fusions and frictions, in which the development and deployment
                of technologies, and the sorts of research questions, demands, and imaginative work that characterize
                the arts and Humanities merge.
            </p>
          
            <p>Find a better label or phrase. </p>
            <p>We’ll rename the manifesto.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, let's get our hands dirty.</p>
