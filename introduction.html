            <h2>A manifesto on manifestos</h2>
            <p>
                A literal handbill, the manifesto reaches out.
                Its manus is both beckoning and fending off.
                It is a hand that has started to work the room hard,
                whether preaching, teaching, laying down or upending the law.
                Little does it matter if the chosen medium is the voice, the body,
                the printed page, or a pixelated scroll.
                Things hidden, if not since the beginning of the world, then at least
                by the generation of our immediate forebears, are being exposed to the day’s harsh light;
                things that waver between the obvious and the scandalous, the heroic and the silly,
                the private and the public. What is urgent is to draw
                a line--the line between sinners and saints, passéists and futurists—while blurring other lines:
                between critics and makers, coders and cogitators, scholars and entertainers.
                If a bit of fun is had along the way, so much the better.
                Time is short; this is a genre in a hurry.
